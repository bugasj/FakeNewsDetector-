# FakeNewsDetector-
Very simple program using a data set of thousands of tweets, both fake and real, in order to implemet a fake news detector. Different external library functions were implemented in order to catch general tendancies in people who tweet fake news including stop words and passive aggressivness. In the end data was fit to the model with a 94% accuracy rate. Very fun begginer experience implementing this.
